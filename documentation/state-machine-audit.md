# OpenRun state machine audit

Audit date: 2026-11-12.
Source revision at the start: `8eeb2500b48ebd9561031dafb5e26eb7399b23c8`.
Source revision after concurrent conversation and history changes: `3d51826601118af2019a534d114a93ac6199b435`.

OpenRun has many state machines beyond its state enums and its eight TLA+ models.
The most consequential ones join thread startup, shutdown, permissions, caller identity, and ownership of a conversation.
Those machines cross actors and socket connections. Several transitions lose their protection across an `await`.

The audit screens all 706 files in the 42 directories under `Sources/`.
It traces the implementations that retain state, their callers, relevant tests, the product decisions, and the formal models.
The inventory includes application behavior and the command-line tool.
It identifies 168 implicit machines, 16 composite machines, and five delegated boundaries: 189 entries in total.
It includes resource lifetimes, bounded queues, incremental parsers, transactions, timers, callbacks, and caches whose validity affects behavior.
It excludes immutable values, pure formatting, and ordinary local loop counters.
The internals of libghostty-vt, AppKit, WebKit, Metal, and launchd are external boundaries, rather than first-party implementations audited here.

This is an audit, not a behavior change or a new product decision.
The application source and the existing tests are unchanged by this audit.


The repairs came after the audit. The section "Results of the repairs" tells what changed.

## Results of the repairs

The repairs went onto `main` on 2026-11-13, one commit for each part.
An independent review of the first version of the repairs found eight more defects, and the commits repair them too.

| Finding | Repair | Commits |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A program that an agent started counts as a program in another session, so the user is asked first. | `4f65d7e9`, `84622721`, `98d211b4` |
| 2 | The registry and the runner reserve a thread before the first wait of a handoff. | `ce679fb2`, `57f73a6e`, `c5692a8f` |
| 3 | A Codex open and a turn start have a generation, which Stop and Close change. | `04df2bc5`, `b934f9d9`, `64a37c66`, `0670dccf` |
| 4 | The runner records a permission wait before a client sees the request. | `180335f6` |
| 5 | The gate `ThreadAdmission` seals thread work at the shutdown. | `b8e3160d`, `0b567edc`, `3c4f8c34` |
| 6 | A close of a thread ends its terminal session. | `888ae135` |
| 7 | A chat pane drops a dead connection and attaches again at the next overview. | `de3a3e9b`, `e40f50bc` |
| 8 | The chat events that wait hold at most 4,096 events and 4 MiB. | `1049913a`, `0ab1fe5c` |
| 9 | The shared step of Open in Terminal keeps the terminal out of the restart records. | `ff771891` |
| 10 | The draft of a chat keeps its held message. | `b421301a` |
| 11 | A failed answer opens its request again, and a failed message goes back into the draft. | `dfbad48b`, `0e1565da` |
| 12 | The terminal view confirms a size that the grid already has. | `dd747b61` |
| 13 | Each owner of a change of the projects or the settings checks its version. | `5b831497` |

The review found these defects in the first version of the repairs:

- While a Codex server started, every caller counted as an agent, also OpenRun.app. Only a program that the session process started counts now (`84622721`).
- A Stop during the start of a Codex turn could leave the thread busy for good, and the message went away with no word (`64a37c66`, `04df2bc5`).
- A Stop that came before Codex answered a turn start ended the app-server of the whole account. Now only the late turn ends (`eaed4f96`).
- The stage of the chat events encoded each event a second time under its lock. The reader now gives the size of the frame (`0ab1fe5c`).
- A thread that ended attached again and showed an alert (`e40f50bc`).
- A permission answer could pass a later stop. The answers now go on the queue of the messages (`dfbad48b`).
- A server of an account could start after the shutdown (`4f65d7e9`).

These limits remain:

- A program that an agent started, and that then left its parent, such as a daemon, escapes the check of finding 1. The terminal path accepts the same limit for `setsid`.
- No test makes a Codex terminal of finding 9 come back after a restart. The change moves one call into the step that both agents use.
- No test plays a Stop that comes while Codex refuses the start of a turn. A test plays a Stop and a Close during the open.

After the last commit of the repairs, the complete `swift test` passed with no failure.
Timing tests of the terminal flow, the chat speed and the row layout failed now and then under the load of other builds. They passed when they ran alone.

## Meaning of an implicit state machine

A machine is implicit when the next valid operation depends on prior events, but no single type represents all legal states and transitions.
An optional process, a task handle, a set of owners, or a queue with a completion can encode a phase just as a Boolean can.
An actor prevents concurrent access to its fields. It does not make a method atomic across an `await`.

The inventory distinguishes three forms:

- **Implicit:** flags, optionals, collections, resource ownership, or control flow carry the phases.
- **Composite:** an explicit enum describes part of the state, but other fields determine which transitions are valid.
- **Delegated:** an external system retains the state and OpenRun exposes or coordinates it.

One row describes one machine or a tightly coupled family with the same owner and transition rules.
Small timer machines remain separate because their cancellation and completion rules differ.
The states in the tables are descriptive names for current behavior. They are not proposed Swift type names.
