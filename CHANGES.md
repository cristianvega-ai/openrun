# CHANGES

This fork turns Warp into a fully offline terminal for enterprise use. Every call to Warp-hosted servers and services has been removed, along with Warp's built-in AI and agent features (Agent Mode, Oz, Warp AI, and others). Core terminal features stay, as does support for third-party CLI agents such as Claude Code and for integrations that the user configures to reach their own services.

Each section below covers one removal (a single commit or a small group of related commits). It lists what was removed or modified, why, and the user-visible impact. See `git log master..offline-terminal` for commit-level detail.
