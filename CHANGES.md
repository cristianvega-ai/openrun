# CHANGES

This fork turns Warp into a fully offline terminal for enterprise use. Every call to Warp-hosted servers and services has been removed, along with Warp's built-in AI and agent features (Agent Mode, Oz, Warp AI, and others). Core terminal features stay, as does support for third-party CLI agents such as Claude Code and for integrations that the user configures to reach their own services.

Each section below covers one removal (a single commit or a small group of related commits). It lists what was removed or modified, why, and the user-visible impact. See `git log master..offline-terminal` for commit-level detail.

## Internal specs, dev-agent config and process skills
**Why:** These files described Warp's internal product/engineering process (feature specs, release and changelog tooling, issue triage, cloud verification on Oz runners, telemetry) or configured tools that fetch Warp-hosted content. None of it applies to an offline enterprise fork, and several skills instruct coding agents to call Warp services.

**Removed:**
- `specs/`, `agents/specs/`, `.agents/specs/` — Warp product and tech specs for past and in-flight features.
- `.warp/` — Warp-team workflows (release cherry-picks, feature-release PRs against `warp-internal`, keychain copy for Warp-Dev auth, bundling by channel) and the `gui-integration-test-video` skill.
- `.warpindexingignore` — ignore list for Warp's AI codebase indexing of this repo.
- `.mcp.json` — project MCP config that launched the GitHub MCP server via `npx`.
- `skills-lock.json` — lock file pinning shared skills fetched from `warpdotdev/common-skills`.
- `.agents/skills/` (also visible through the `.claude/skills` symlink): `add-telemetry`, `changelog-draft` (with its scripts), `classify-changelog-pr`, `cross-platform-cloud-verification`, `dedupe-issue-local`, `triage-issue-local`, `review-pr-local`, `gui-onboarding-verification-skill`, `gui-reproduce-bug-report-local`, `tui-verify-change`, `gui-create-launch-modal`. These covered Warp telemetry, the changelog/release process, warpdotdev issue triage, Oz cloud-agent runners, `WARP_API_KEY` dogfood builds, and a launch modal that depends on sign-in state and cloud-synced settings.

**Modified:**
- None. The remaining generic engineering skills (`add-feature-flag`, `remove-feature-flag`, `gui-integration-test`, `gui-settings-ui`, `gui-ui-guidelines`, `rust-unit-tests`, `tui-testing`, `tui-ui-guidelines`, `promote-feature`, `logging-and-error-reporting`) are left unedited for a later rewrite.

**User-visible impact:** None for terminal users. Contributors lose the Warp-internal specs, workflows and process skills. Coding agents no longer have access to the removed skills.

**Notes:** No build script, `include_str!` or `include_dir!` referenced the deleted paths. The `specs/` copy in `flake.nix` targets the vendored `warp-workflows` git dependency, not this repo. References left for later tasks:
- `script/bootstrap`, `script/run`, `script/resolve_common_skills`, `script/windows/bootstrap.ps1` still install skills from `warpdotdev/common-skills`. They recreate `skills-lock.json` by fetching from GitHub.
- `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `FAQ.md` still describe `specs/`, `skills-lock.json` and the common-skills install.
- Kept skills still name deleted skills: `tui-verify-change` in `gui-integration-test`, `gui-ui-guidelines` and `tui-ui-guidelines`, and `gui-integration-test-video` in `gui-integration-test`, `rust-unit-tests` and `tui-testing`.
- Code comments cite deleted specs by path: `app/src/settings_view/mcp_servers_page.rs`, `app/src/settings_view/mcp_servers_page_tests.rs`, `app/src/settings_view/mcp_servers/list_page.rs`, `app/src/settings_view/mod_tests.rs`, `app/src/preview_config_migration.rs`, `app/src/terminal/model/session/command_executor.rs`, `app/src/ai/blocklist/block/view_impl/common.rs`, `crates/warp_util/src/git.rs`, `crates/warp_server_client/src/base_client.rs`, `crates/warp_multi_agent_client/src/lib.rs`.
- The app's own handling of `.warp/`, `.mcp.json` and `.warpindexingignore` in users' projects is product code and is unaffected by this change.
- `.github/workflows/changelog_draft.yml` and `create_release.yml` call the deleted `changelog-draft` skill. The CI replacement commit removes them.
