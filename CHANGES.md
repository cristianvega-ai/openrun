# CHANGES

This fork turns Warp into a fully offline terminal for enterprise use. Every call to Warp-hosted servers and services has been removed, along with Warp's built-in AI and agent features (Agent Mode, Oz, Warp AI, and others). Core terminal features stay, as does support for third-party CLI agents such as Claude Code and for integrations that the user configures to reach their own services.

Each section below covers one removal (a single commit or a small group of related commits). It lists what was removed or modified, why, and the user-visible impact. See `git log master..offline-terminal` for commit-level detail.

## Internal specs, dev-agent config and process skills
**Why:** These files described Warp's internal product/engineering process (feature specs, release and changelog tooling, issue triage, cloud verification on Oz runners, telemetry) or configured tools that fetch Warp-hosted content. None of it applies to an offline enterprise fork, and several skills instruct coding agents to call Warp services.

**Removed:**
- `specs/`, `agents/specs/`, `.agents/specs/` — Warp product and tech specs for past and in-flight features.
- `.warp/` — Warp-team workflows (release cherry-picks, feature-release PRs against `warp-internal`, keychain copy for Warp-Dev auth, bundling by channel) and the `gui-integration-test-video` skill.
- `.warpindexingignore` — ignore list for Warp's AI codebase indexing of this repo.
- `.mcp.json` — project MCP config that launched the GitHub MCP server via `npx`.
- `skills-lock.json` — lock file pinning shared skills fetched from `warpdotdev/common-skills`.
- `.agents/skills/` (also visible through the `.claude/skills` symlink): `add-telemetry`, `changelog-draft` (with its scripts), `classify-changelog-pr`, `cross-platform-cloud-verification`, `dedupe-issue-local`, `triage-issue-local`, `review-pr-local`, `gui-onboarding-verification-skill`, `gui-reproduce-bug-report-local`, `tui-verify-change`, `gui-create-launch-modal`. These covered Warp telemetry, the changelog/release process, warpdotdev issue triage, Oz cloud-agent runners, `WARP_API_KEY` dogfood builds, and a launch modal that depends on sign-in state and cloud-synced settings.

**Modified:**
- None. The remaining generic engineering skills (`add-feature-flag`, `remove-feature-flag`, `gui-integration-test`, `gui-settings-ui`, `gui-ui-guidelines`, `rust-unit-tests`, `tui-testing`, `tui-ui-guidelines`, `promote-feature`, `logging-and-error-reporting`) are left unedited for a later rewrite.

**User-visible impact:** None for terminal users. Contributors lose the Warp-internal specs, workflows and process skills. Coding agents no longer have access to the removed skills.

**Notes:** No build script, `include_str!` or `include_dir!` referenced the deleted paths. The `specs/` copy in `flake.nix` targets the vendored `warp-workflows` git dependency, not this repo. References left for later tasks:
- `script/bootstrap`, `script/run`, `script/resolve_common_skills`, `script/windows/bootstrap.ps1` still install skills from `warpdotdev/common-skills`. They recreate `skills-lock.json` by fetching from GitHub.
- `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `FAQ.md` still describe `specs/`, `skills-lock.json` and the common-skills install.
- Kept skills still name deleted skills: `tui-verify-change` in `gui-integration-test`, `gui-ui-guidelines` and `tui-ui-guidelines`, and `gui-integration-test-video` in `gui-integration-test`, `rust-unit-tests` and `tui-testing`.
- Code comments cite deleted specs by path: `app/src/settings_view/mcp_servers_page.rs`, `app/src/settings_view/mcp_servers_page_tests.rs`, `app/src/settings_view/mcp_servers/list_page.rs`, `app/src/settings_view/mod_tests.rs`, `app/src/preview_config_migration.rs`, `app/src/terminal/model/session/command_executor.rs`, `app/src/ai/blocklist/block/view_impl/common.rs`, `crates/warp_util/src/git.rs`, `crates/warp_server_client/src/base_client.rs`, `crates/warp_multi_agent_client/src/lib.rs`.
- The app's own handling of `.warp/`, `.mcp.json` and `.warpindexingignore` in users' projects is product code and is unaffected by this change.
- `.github/workflows/changelog_draft.yml` and `create_release.yml` call the deleted `changelog-draft` skill. The CI replacement commit removes them.

## Continuous integration
**Why:** Warp's GitHub automation ran on Warp infrastructure and called Warp services: Namespace and larger-runner pools, GCP workload identity for SSH tests, Trunk test analytics, the private `warp-channel-config` repo via `WARP_CHANNEL_CONFIG_ACCESS_SSH_KEY`, Sentry uploads, Apple notarization, Azure code signing, `OZ_MGMT_*` cloud-agent jobs, Slack notifications, and repo-sync to `warp-internal`. None of that is available or wanted in an offline enterprise fork.

**Removed:**
- `.github/workflows/`: all 21 workflows (Warp CI, release cutting, create/delete release, changelog draft, build-cache population, agent-dev image publish, repo-sync, PR-check sync, approval checks, stale/fix-PR cleanup, external-contributor labelling, docs notifications, feature-flag cleanup, docubot, and the dedupe/triage/PR-review skill updaters), plus `README.md` and `release_configurations.json` (release-channel, Sentry and Slack settings).
- `.github/actions/`: `prepare_environment`, `get_channel_config`, `docubot` and `bundle_arch_package`.
- `.github/STAKEHOLDERS`, `.github/issue-triage/`, `.github/scripts/`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` (cherry-pick and feature-flag release templates).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` (contact links to Warp docs, Slack, Discord and the website) and the SSH-specific issue templates `03_ssh_tmux.yml` and `04_ssh_legacy.yml`.

**Modified:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — new minimal workflow for `push` and `pull_request` on `ubuntu-latest`. It has three jobs: `./script/format --check`; `cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`; and `cargo nextest run --locked --workspace -E 'not package(integration)'` (nextest installed with `taiki-e/install-action`). It installs the apt build and test packages from `script/linux/install_build_deps`, `install_runtime_deps` and `install_test_deps`, uses `protobuf-compiler` from apt, and pulls Git LFS objects. It uses no secrets. A `TODO(offline-audit)` comment marks where the offline-audit job goes.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01_bug_report.yml`, `02_feature_request.yml` — generic forms with no Warp links, AI debugging IDs or Linear labels. The bug report has an optional session-type field (local/SSH) in place of the separate SSH templates.
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` — generic description, testing and checklist sections, including a reminder to update `CHANGES.md`. The Agent Mode checkbox and the `CHANGELOG-*` lines are gone.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — dropped the private `github-private` registry and its PAT secret, the `warpdotdev/tech-leads` assignees and the Namespace action group. Cargo security updates and grouped GitHub Actions updates remain.

**User-visible impact:** None in the app. Contributors get one CI check, which runs on GitHub-hosted runners. CI no longer runs integration tests, doc tests, Windows/macOS/wasm builds, release-flag compilation, license, WGSL or ShellCheck checks, or Diesel schema checks. Releases are no longer cut or published automatically.

**Notes:**
- Scripts with no remaining callers: `script/sentry_upload_dif.sh`, `script/sentry_create_release.sh`, `script/create_release_tag_and_branch`, `script/push-dev-image`, `script/deploy_remote_server_to_test_vm`, `script/linux/sign_arch_packages`, `script/windows/build_inno_sign_tool_command.ps1`, `script/windows/test_tui_installer.ps1`. `docker/agent-dev/Dockerfile` was only built by the deleted image-publish workflow.
- Comments that cite deleted workflows: `script/install_cargo_test_deps` (wgslfmt version kept in sync with `ci.yml`), `script/linux/bundle` and `crates/remote_server/src/preinstall_check.sh` (both cite `create_release.yml`).
- `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` still tell contributors to add `CHANGELOG-*` lines from the PR template.
- The build still fetches git dependencies from `github.com/warpdotdev/*` repos listed in `Cargo.lock`.

## Developer scripts: Warp infrastructure
**Why:** The developer scripts pulled a private config tool from Warp's GitHub, fetched Warp's shared agent skills from `warpdotdev/common-skills`, required a Google Cloud login, uploaded to Sentry and GCS, and deployed to Warp's VMs and image registry. None of that works offline or without Warp accounts.

**Removed:**
- `script/install_channel_config` — installed the private `warp-channel-config` tool. `warp-oss` does not need it.
- `script/resolve_common_skills` — downloaded Warp's shared agent skills from `warpdotdev/common-skills`. `skills-lock.json` was already removed with the process skills. The `--install-common-skills*` / `--skip-common-skills` flags and the `WARP_SKIP_COMMON_SKILLS_INSTALL` / `WARP_COMMON_SKILLS_*` variables are gone.
- `script/sentry_create_release.sh`, `script/sentry_upload_dif.sh`, `script/macos/update_sentry_cocoa` — created Sentry releases, uploaded debug files and downloaded the Sentry Cocoa SDK.
- `script/deploy_remote_server`, `script/deploy_remote_server_to_test_vm` — deployed the SSH remote server to dev hosts and Warp's GCP test VM.
- `script/push-dev-image`, `docker/agent-dev/` — built and pushed the cloud-agent / warp-server development image.
- `script/create_release_tag_and_branch` — Warp's release tagging workflow.
- `script/test_factory_files_skill.py` — tests for the factory-files skill, which validates against warp-server. Removed from `script/presubmit` too.
- `script/font_fallback/` — regenerated font fallback tables from `gs://warp-static-assets`. Also removed its `downloaded_fonts` entry from `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`.

**Modified:**
- `script/run` — always builds `warp-oss`. Removed the channel config install, local/OSS detection, common-skills install, the `--host-id` cloud-mode flag and the legacy `with_local_server` / `with_local_session_sharing_server` / `with_sandbox_telemetry` feature mapping (those variables were read only by `warp-channel-config`). It now passes only `FEATURES` to `script/macos/run`.
- `script/macos/run` — builds `WarpOss.app` only. Removed the WarpLocal paths, `FRAMEWORK_OVERRIDE`, the `cocoa_sentry` framework copy and the Sentry-only rpath step.
- `script/run-tui` — always builds `warp-tui-oss`. No channel config.
- `script/install_cargo_build_deps` — no channel config install.
- `script/bootstrap`, `script/macos/bootstrap`, `script/linux/bootstrap`, `script/windows/bootstrap.ps1` — removed gcloud install and auth, `--skip-gcloud-auth` / `WARP_SKIP_GCLOUD_AUTH`, common-skills installation and `sentry-cli`.
- `script/linux/install_test_deps`, `docker/linux-dev/` — no Google Cloud apt repo or `google-cloud-cli`. The README no longer mounts `~/.config/gcloud` and runs `warp-oss`.
- `script/wasm/bundle`, `script/wasm/run` — removed the channel-config feature mapping. The local wasm run uses the `oss` channel.
- `.vscode/tasks.json`, `.vscode/launch.json` — removed the WarpLocal, local session-sharing, `with_local_server` and `fast_dev` configs. The remaining build and debug configs use `warp-oss` / `WarpOss.app`.

**User-visible impact:** None for end users. Developers need no Google Cloud account and no access to Warp's private repos. `./script/run` and `./script/bootstrap` no longer download anything from Warp.

**Notes:** `app/build.rs` still calls the deleted `update_sentry_cocoa` when the `cocoa_sentry` feature is on. The default build does not enable it, and removing Sentry from `app/` and `Cargo.toml` is a separate change. `AGENTS.md` still documents the common-skills flags, `resolve_common_skills` and `WITH_LOCAL_SERVER`, and will be updated separately.
